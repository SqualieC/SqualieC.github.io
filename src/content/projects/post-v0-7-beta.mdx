## What it does

Post is a desktop sticky-note style overlay built for gaming sessions. It stays on top, supports adjustable opacity, can switch to click-through mode so it does not steal game input, and saves notes as plain `.txt` files.

## Core controls

- `Ctrl+Alt+N`: toggle `Lock` / `Edit`
- `Ctrl+Alt+M`: show / hide overlay
- `Ctrl+Alt+E`: force recovery back to editable mode
- `Esc`: lock immediately
- `Ctrl+S`: save note
- `Ctrl+O`: open note file

## Included in this beta download

- `post_overlay.py` main app
- `Post.pyw` double-click launcher (no terminal window)
- `Post.bat` launcher fallback
- `README.md` quick guide and troubleshooting
- `post_note.txt` default note file

## Notes

- Requires Python on Windows to run the `.py` / `.pyw` launchers.
- State is persisted in `post_state.json` after first launch (window size, position, opacity, and last file).
