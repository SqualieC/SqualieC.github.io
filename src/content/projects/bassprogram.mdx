## What it does

BassProgram is a practical workflow bundle for bass practice and track preparation.

## Download options

- **BassProgram Alpha .1**: full release with enhanced bass sound assets and advanced pack contents.
- **BassProgram Alpha .1 Lite**: lightweight package for quick setup and lower download size.

## Hosting note

The full Alpha build is hosted via GitHub Releases instead of Cloudflare static assets because Cloudflare Workers static files have a 25 MiB per-file cap.

## Next improvements

- add explicit feature matrix per release
- publish release notes per alpha build
- add in-app quickstart and sample workflow templates
