## What it does

BassProgram is a practical workflow bundle for bass practice and track preparation.

## Download

Use the **Download** button above to get the latest package.

## Package notes

The current public package is a **source package** (no prebuilt exe) to reduce antivirus false positives.\nIt includes `main.py`, dependencies, and a `run_windows.bat` launcher.\nAdvanced PSARC/toolchain features are not bundled in this lightweight package.

## Next improvements

- add explicit feature matrix per release
- publish full and core variants with separate download buttons
- add in-app quickstart and sample workflow templates
