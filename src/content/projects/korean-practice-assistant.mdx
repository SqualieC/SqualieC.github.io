## Intent

Centralize practical Korean drills into one browser-first tool that is always online.

## Current online tool

The live version includes:

- randomized everyday sentence mode
- randomized beginner word mode
- translation reveal workflow
- Korean audio playback using pre-rendered edge-tts (`ko-KR-SunHiNeural`) with browser fallback

## Planned sections

- spaced-repetition friendly prompts
- quick grammar checkpoints
- pronunciation drill hooks for mic-enabled feedback later
